# SkyscraperDaredevil

You will assume the role of a daredevil attempting to cross the skies from one skyscraper to another.
Avoid spikes, saws, falling platforms, and more as you traverse through the levels.

This is a video game created by me, Aranvihn Clark. The project started as a way for me to ease my way into making my own video game and I wanted to start somewhere easy (hence, a platformer). This is was done with a couple of hours of work each day for the last 2 months (minus weekends usually). I will continue my work on this a until I finish just a little more polish. If you decide to try it out, hopefully you will enjoy the couple of minutes this game will provide.
